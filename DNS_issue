Troubleshooting network issues

This course is not approved or sponsored by Red Hat.
Introduction

In this exercise, you will need to troubleshoot and resolve connectivity issues to a web server.

Server1 (10.0.1.10) is running Apache.

Server2 (10.0.1.11) must be able to view Server1's Apache content via http://ip-10.0.1.10.ec2.internal using elinks (not currently installed).
Solution

Start by logging in to the lab servers using the credentials provided on the hands-on lab page:
ssh cloud_user@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS

Become the root user:
sudo su -

Be sure to log in to both Server1 and Server2 in separate tabs or windows.
Verify Server1

    Verify Server1 is running Apache:
     systemctl status httpd

    Verify Apache is listening on port 80:
     ss -lntp | grep 80

    Verify the content can be accessed locally:
     curl localhost

    Verify the firewall is permitting port 80 traffic:
     firewall-cmd --list-all

    Permit inbound traffic to Apache:
     firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http

    Reload the firewall to pickup the change:
     firewall-cmd --reload

Verify Server2

On Server2 (10.0.1.11)

    Attempt to pull the web content from Server1 via hostname:
     curl ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal

    Attempt to pull the web content from Server1 via IP
     curl 10.0.1.10

    Check to see what DNS hosts are being used:
     cat /etc/resolv.conf

    Verify resolution via the specified host:
     dig @10.0.0.2 ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal

    Verify /etc/nsswitch.conf:
     vim /etc/nsswitch.conf

    Add dns to the hosts: line. It should look like this:
     hosts:	files dns myhostname

    Save and close the file:
     :wq

    Attempt to pull the web content from Server1 via hostname:
     curl ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal

    Ping ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal:
     ping ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal

    Review /etc/hosts:
    vim /etc/hosts

    Remove the following line:
    10.0.1.1	ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal

    Save and close the file:
    :wq

    Attempt to pull the web content from Server1 via hostname:
    curl ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal

    Install elinks:
    yum install -y elinks

    Use elinks to view the content:
    links -dump http://ip-10-0-1-10.ec2.internal
